# ToDo List – Study Project

This project is a **study application** built with React, based on the layout and idea of Rocketseat’s ToDo challenge, and adapted for personal learning purposes.

## 💡 Goal

- Practice fundamental React concepts (components, state, immutability).
- Recreate a modern task list layout inspired by Rocketseat’s challenge.
- Organize the codebase in a clean way to make future features easier to add.

## ✅ What’s done so far

- Main ToDo screen with:
  - Task creation.
  - Task listing.
  - Marking tasks as completed.
  - Deleting tasks.
- Counters for created and completed tasks.
- Responsive dark-theme layout inspired by Rocketseat’s design.

## 🔜 Next steps

The next step for this project is to:

- Integrate authentication and data persistence with **Firebase**, including:
  - Login and sign up (with Google login support).
  - Per-user task storage, so each user can access their own lists across sessions and devices.

This repository will be updated as new features are implemented.
